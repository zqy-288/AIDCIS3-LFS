```python
# High-priority signals process immediately
throttler.emit_throttled("critical_update", data, priority=SignalPriority.HIGH)

# Normal signals batch for efficiency
throttler.emit_throttled("status_update", data, priority=SignalPriority.NORMAL)
```

### 3. Efficient Data Loading
```python
# Automatic strategy selection based on data size
loader = OptimizedDataLoader()
strategy = loader.optimize_loading_strategy(data_size)
collection = loader.load_hole_collection_optimized(data, strategy)
```
