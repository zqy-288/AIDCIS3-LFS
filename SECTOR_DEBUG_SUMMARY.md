# Sector Division Debug Summary

## Debug Code Added

### 1. Enhanced Sector Collection Creation Debug
- Added comprehensive logging in `_create_sector_collections()` method
- Logs total hole count, center point, and sample hole IDs
- For each sector, logs:
  - Number of holes assigned
  - Sample hole IDs
  - Angle range of holes in that sector
- Warns if any holes are not assigned to any sector

### 2. Improved Hole-Sector Assignment Debug
- Added debug logging in `_is_hole_in_sector()` method
- Logs the first 10 hole positions, angles, and sector assignments
- Fixed the sector angle ranges:
  - SECTOR_1: 0°-90° (right-upper)
  - SECTOR_2: 90°-180° (left-upper)
  - SECTOR_3: 180°-270° (left-lower)
  - SECTOR_4: 270°-360° (right-lower)

### 3. ID Matching Debug in Sector Switching
- Enhanced `switch_to_sector()` method with ID format checking
- Logs GraphicsView hole ID format vs. sector collection ID format
- Implements ID normalization to handle different formats:
  - H001, H00001 -> 001
  - C001R001 -> 001_001
  - (1,1) -> 1_1
  - hole_1 -> 1
- Tracks holes matched by normalization

### 4. Sector View Creation Debug
- Added logging in `_create_sector_views()` method
- Shows all sector collections and their hole counts
- Logs sample hole IDs for each sector view created

### 5. Center Point Calculation Debug
- Enhanced `_calculate_center()` to log both:
  - Bounding box center (currently used)
  - Average center (for comparison)
  - The difference between them

### 6. Visibility Verification Method
- Added `_debug_verify_sector_visibility()` method
- Called after each sector switch
- Reports:
  - Number of visible/hidden holes
  - Sample visible hole IDs
  - Any holes visible that shouldn't be (wrong sector)

## Test Script
Created `test_sector_division.py` which:
- Tests angle calculation logic
- Creates test holes in all four quadrants
- Verifies sector assignment is working correctly
- Results show the math is correct

## Key Findings
1. The sector division math is working correctly
2. The issue is likely in ID format mismatches between:
   - Hole IDs in sector collections
   - Hole IDs in the graphics view hole_items dictionary
3. The normalization logic should help match different ID formats

## Next Steps
1. Run the application with these debug logs enabled
2. Check the console output when switching sectors
3. Look for:
   - ID format mismatches
   - Holes not found warnings
   - Incorrect visibility states
4. The debug output will pinpoint exactly where the ID mismatch occurs
